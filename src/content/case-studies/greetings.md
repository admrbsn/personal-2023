## Overview
In the ever-evolving digital landscape, the quest for meaningful connections remains paramount. Recognizing the burgeoning market of digital gifting and greetings, Tribute ventured to redefine this space with the launch of Tribute Greetings in 2022. The inception of this mobile app stems from a keen observation of the e-commerce gifting market's trajectory towards a $1T valuation and the e-card market's exponential growth. Tribute Greetings is designed to bridge the gap in the digital gifting and greetings sector by offering a platform that emphasizes emotional connection through curated gifts and personalized video greetings. This case study outlines the strategic approach undertaken by the Tribute team to introduce a product that stands out in a crowded market by prioritizing meaningful interactions.

## Problem & Opportunity
The digital gifting and e-card markets have shown remarkable growth, signaling a shift in consumer behavior towards online means of celebration and appreciation. Despite this, a significant void existed in the market: the lack of personal touch and meaningfulness in digital greetings and gifts. The prevalent offerings failed to capture the essence of what makes a gift truly special - its ability to convey deep personal sentiment and create a lasting emotional impact. This realization paved the way for Tribute Greetings, which aimed to revolutionize the industry by making digital gifting a profoundly personal experience.

## Solution
Tribute Greetings distinguishes itself by focusing on meaningful curation and facilitating emotional connections. The app integrates features like:
* **Curated Gifts:** A selection of thoughtful gift cards, flowers, and artisanal goods, moving beyond conventional e-gift cards.
* **Prompt Cards:** Designed to inspire heartfelt messages and personalize video greetings, enhancing the emotional value of every tribute.
* **Group Gifting Experience:** Enabling friends, family, or coworkers to collectively contribute to a greeting, thereby amplifying its significance.

## Features and Differentiation
At its core, Tribute Greetings leverages Tribute's existing brand reputation for creating meaningful experiences. However, it introduces several novel features that set it apart:

* **Brand and Message:** Tribute's emphasis on gratitude and meaningful connections is deeply embedded in every aspect of the app.
* **Prompt Statements:** These guide users in creating personalized messages, addressing one of the key challenges in digital gifting - conveying genuine emotion.
* **Reminders Feature:** Ensures users never miss an opportunity to make someone feel special.
* **Story Player Experience:** A familiar, engaging way to view greetings, drawing inspiration from popular social media platforms.

## Target Audience

* **Grateful Gill:** Active on social media, values mindfulness and looks for opportunities to celebrate achievements.
* **Leader Lee:** Aims to reinforce corporate values through personalized gestures of appreciation.
* **Gifter Gray:** Seeks meaningful gifts that convey a deep sense of connection and appreciation.

## Business Model
Tribute Greetings introduces a multifaceted revenue model:

* **eGift Card Affiliates:** Capitalizing on popular e-gift cards, with a focus on leveraging breakage and affiliate discounts.
* **Pro Subscriptions:** Offering enhanced features such as no processing fees, access to exclusive card designs, and priority support.
* **Diverse Gift Marketplace:** Expanding beyond eGift cards to include a wide range of curated gifts, with higher affiliate percentages.

## User Research
The Tribute Greetings team embarked on a comprehensive user research journey to ensure the new app would resonate with the target audience's needs and desires. Leveraging a blend of qualitative tools and methodologies, the objective was to gather actionable insights that would inform the app's design and feature set, making sure it provided a valuable and engaging user experience.

### Approach and Methodologies
Using platforms like Lookback.com and PlaybookUX.com, the team conducted a mix of moderated and unmoderated UX research sessions. Moderated sessions, lasting between 30 to 60 minutes, allowed for deep dives into users' experiences with the Tribute website and their expectations for a new digital gifting product. The focus was on understanding the emotional and functional aspects of digital gifting, gathering feedback on potential features, and assessing the overall appeal of a one-to-one gifting solution.

Simultaneously, unmoderated sessions offered insights into how users interacted with prototype features, providing valuable data on usability and user flow preferences. Card sorting and tree testing exercises further helped refine the app's information architecture, ensuring intuitive navigation and a seamless user experience.

### Tool for Synthesis and Analysis
The wealth of data collected from these sessions was meticulously organized and analyzed using Dovetail, a platform chosen for its robust capabilities in handling and synthesizing UX research data. This allowed the team to identify common themes, user needs, and preferences, facilitating a data-driven approach to product development. Dovetail's collaborative features ensured that insights were accessible across the team, enabling informed decision-making and prioritization of features and design elements.

### Key Insights
The user research phase underscored a significant demand for a more personal, one-to-one gifting experience, validating the team's hypothesis about market needs. Insights into preferred card designs, media entry formats (text, video, audio), and the types of gifts users were interested in were particularly influential. Additionally, understanding the contexts in which users would engage with the app informed the integration of features like reminders and the choice of delivery methods (text message or email).

### Impact
This phase of user research was pivotal, not only in confirming the need for a one-to-one digital gifting solution but also in shaping the app's development direction. The insights gathered were instrumental in ensuring that Tribute Greetings would offer a meaningful, user-friendly platform that stands out in the digital gifting space.

## Jammin' in FigJam
Armed with valuable insights from our user research, we moved to refine our early prototypes using FigJam. This stage was crucial for detailing the app's journey and flows, ensuring they aligned with our users' needs and preferences. As the Director of Product Design, I not only contributed directly to the design efforts but also guided our two designers on the team through the prototyping process. Our focus was on creating intuitive, user-friendly interfaces that would bring the concept of one-to-one digital gifting to life.

## Designing the MVP
With the foundational insights from FigJam, we transitioned to designing the MVP of Tribute Greetings. Operating under a tight timeline, we employed weekly design sprints to rapidly iterate and refine our concepts. Essential to these sprints were "Crazy Eights" and "Solution Sketches," techniques that spurred creativity and quickly surfaced a range of solutions. These methods proved invaluable in focusing our efforts and ensuring that our design decisions were both innovative and user-centered.

The app was structured around two main user flows: gift giving and gift receiving, each encompassing several smaller, interconnected flows. This approach allowed us to concentrate on optimizing each step of the user journey, ensuring a seamless and engaging experience for both senders and recipients.

## User Research (Again)
After developing high-fidelity designs, our next step was to validate the app's UI with end users. For this, we turned to Maze.co, a platform that specializes in task-oriented, unmoderated design testing. Maze allowed us to quickly gather actionable feedback by simulating real-world use cases and tracking how users interacted with our designs.

We reached out to our existing base of 2 million Tribute creators through email, inviting them to participate in these tests. This strategy ensured we received feedback from users already familiar with the Tribute brand but potentially new to the Greetings concept.

The findings from Maze revealed insightful nuances about our design choices. Contrary to our initial assumptions, the importance of audio features and social connectivity options was overestimated. Feedback indicated a clear user preference for simplicity and directness in sending greetings. Users expressed fatigue with the over-saturation of social networks and desired a more straightforward, focused experience for expressing sentiments.

## Building it out with Ionic
With the design phase behind us and a solid understanding of user preferences, our next challenge was the development of Tribute Greetings. Given a 2-month deadline, we decided to leverage Ionic, coupled with Vue for the frontend logic and Tailwind CSS for styling. Despite my past experience with an earlier version of Ionic, this was a new adventure for the team of six engineers, none of whom had previously worked with Ionic.

### Strategy and Tools
Our plan was clear: start with a mobile/responsive web version that could later be expanded to native iOS and Android apps without the need to overhaul the core application. This approach allowed us to utilize web technologies (JavaScript, HTML, CSS) for a quicker deployment and the flexibility to iterate rapidly. Using Vue alongside Ionic enabled us to create a responsive and performant user interface, while Tailwind CSS facilitated the styling with minimal effort. Storybook played a crucial role in testing and documenting the UI components, ensuring consistency and reusability across the app.

### Advantages of Our Approach
* **Speed and Efficiency:** Building with web technologies meant we could deploy quickly and easily adjust based on user feedback.
* **Leveraging Existing Infrastructure:** Authentication, sign-up, and the marketplace features from the existing Tribute website could be reused, saving significant development time.
* **Avoiding App Store Hassles:** By focusing first on a web app, we sidestepped delays from app store reviews and avoided the in-app purchase fees imposed by platforms like Apple.
* **SEO and User Acquisition:** Hosting the app under the Tribute domain benefited from existing SEO, making it easier to drive traffic to the new product.

### Development Phases
1. **Phase 1 - Web:** We started by creating a new Django app for Greetings, integrating it closely with our existing backend and leveraging Django Rest Framework for the APIs. The front-end app was built using Ionic and Vue, served from a dedicated subdirectory or subdomain to maximize SEO benefits.
2. **Phase 2 - iOS:** The next step involved rewriting the authentication flow for a native experience, setting up API-based authentication, and re-engineering the marketplace components to fit the mobile UI. Special attention was given to in-app purchasing and exploring ways to minimize app store fees.
3. **Phase 3 - Android:** While initially planned, the specifics of the Android app development were to be determined based on the learnings from the web and iOS phases.

Throughout this journey, our focus remained on creating an intuitive and engaging user experience that mirrored the simplicity and emotional resonance discovered during our user research phases. The use of Ionic allowed for a seamless transition from web to mobile platforms, ensuring that Tribute Greetings would be accessible to everyone, everywhere, regardless of the device.

## Conclusion
Tribute Greetings represents a strategic expansion for Tribute, targeting the digital gifting market with a product that prioritizes meaningfulness over mere transaction. By addressing the gaps in the current market, Tribute Greetings sets a new standard for how we celebrate and appreciate each other in the digital age. As the app evolves, it will continue to focus on deepening connections and enriching lives, one greeting at a time.
