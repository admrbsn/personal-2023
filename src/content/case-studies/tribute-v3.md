## Background

At the start of 2025, it was clear the Tribute platform had reached a breaking point.

What began nearly ten years earlier as a small side project had grown into an emotionally meaningful product used by millions. However, the foundation had not kept pace with that growth. Over time, we made incremental improvements to individual areas—authentication, recording, public viewing—but the overall experience from onboarding to checkout and delivery felt fragmented, outdated, and increasingly fragile.

Band-aids were starting to fall off.

Tribute V3 was not a visual refresh. It was a full re-architecture of how creators and participants experience the product, how customization works, and how the platform could evolve moving forward.

## Problem

We identified three core issues holding the platform back.

### Fragmented, aging flows

Nearly every major surface needed attention—onboarding, publishing, tribute management, guest invitations, editing, checkout, and delivery. Each flow had been improved independently over the years, resulting in an experience that felt inconsistent to users and increasingly difficult to maintain internally.

### Limited creative control

Tribute is inherently emotional and expressive, yet customization felt rigid. Users frequently asked for more control over themes, colors, and personality. The product didn’t reflect the emotional weight it carried.

### Artificial separation between creators and participants

Creators and participants were effectively using different products. This fractured experience caused confusion, inconsistent UI patterns, and a loss of shared context. We looked to products like Partiful and Paperless Post, which treat creators and guests as collaborators in the same space, differentiated by permissions rather than separate interfaces.

## Framing the Direction

Before jumping to solutions, I needed to understand how people mentally approached creating a tribute—and what actually mattered to them in the process.

### Journey mapping and competitive teardown

I spent an intensive afternoon breaking down products like Partiful and Paperless Post, mapping their journeys from creation to completion. I focused on decision points, emotional highs and lows, and moments of friction.

A clear pattern emerged: the strongest experiences felt like one continuous space that subtly adapted based on who you were and what you could do.

That insight became the backbone of Tribute V3.

### Prioritizing what matters through ranking exercises

Rather than relying on assumptions or feature checklists, we ran a contextual feature-ranking exercise using Maze. Participants were asked to imagine creating a tribute for someone important and rank core features by importance during creation.

The features included:
- Video messages
- Theme and visual customization
- Music
- Ordering and editing content
- Cover text and messaging

This forced tradeoffs and gave us a clearer signal than grouping alone.

Several patterns stood out:
- Video messages were consistently the primary driver of value
- Customization ranked higher than expected, reinforcing emotional expression as core
- Structural features mattered, but users expected them to stay out of the way

These rankings directly informed visual hierarchy, default emphasis, and which controls were surfaced early versus deferred.

## Testing early assumptions

One early idea didn’t hold up.

Inspired by Partiful, I initially wanted the product page—with placeholder data—to *be* the create experience. It looked slick and modern, but false-door testing and moderated interviews revealed confusion. Users weren’t sure what to do next or whether they were “doing it right.”

We pivoted to a more conventional modal-based start, with the new experience blurred behind it as a teaser. This preserved clarity while still signaling what users were about to unlock.

## Shaping the Experience

With direction validated, the focus shifted to shaping the experience and testing it in increasingly concrete ways.

### Reimagining onboarding

The existing onboarding flow technically worked, but lacked personality. It was essentially a homemade Typeform. Conversion improved over time—from ~15% to ~25%—but it didn’t reflect the product’s joy.

For V3, onboarding needed to:
- Feel expressive and celebratory
- Tease customization early
- Reduce perceived effort
- Build confidence immediately

Post-launch, onboarding conversion increased to **54%**, more than doubling the historical baseline.

### Payments, commitment, and clarity

Historically, payment happened at the very end of the experience. While generous, it caused real issues:
- Ad spend was attributed to abandoned tributes
- Late-stage abandonment stayed high
- **16% of checkouts were accidental**

Users were signaling readiness to pay earlier, but the flow wasn’t designed to support that intent.

We moved payment to just after the draft stage—keeping the product free to start while aligning payment with commitment and clarity.

### Themes and emotional expression

Years of research pointed to a simple truth: users love emojis.

That insight became the foundation of our default theme—animated, occasion-based emoji backgrounds. From there, we expanded into additional themes like balloons, fireworks, graduation caps, and seasonal motifs.

Themes became a primary way users expressed intent and emotion, not just decoration.

### Prototyping, iteration, and AI-assisted workflows

Once the foundation was in place, we moved quickly.

I bounced between Figma for layout exploration and AI-assisted coding environments for rapid implementation. This approach accelerated the first 60–70% of the work, allowing more time for refinement, validation, and polish.

Speed alone wasn’t enough. As complexity grew, quality required discipline. Weak prompts could introduce regressions, so I continuously tightened constraints, updated the design system, and supplemented AI workflows with concrete Figma screens to remove ambiguity.

### Continuous validation

Beyond milestone testing, we relied heavily on unmoderated Maze surveys throughout the process. These lightweight tests helped pressure-test copy, validate feature placement, and gauge emotional response—without slowing momentum.

## Launch and Outcomes

The redesigned platform launched with meaningful improvements across the board:

- Starts: **+29%**
- Start → publish: **+24%**
- Purchases: **+19%**
- Participant engagement: **+10%**
- CSAT: **+20%**

Beyond the numbers, V3 provided a modern, scalable foundation. Iteration became safer, experimentation cheaper, and future improvements easier to ship.

## Reflection

Tribute V3 wasn’t about trends or tools. It was about aligning the platform with what the product had already become—emotionally meaningful and deeply personal.

It also changed how we build. Design and engineering now operate around shared systems, experimentation carries less risk, and ideas move from concept to reality faster without sacrificing quality.

V3 set a new baseline for how we work at Tribute going forward.
